GENERAL APPROACH:
- each tlmgr package becomes texlive-$pkgname
- .ARCH prefixes are renamed to -bin (so dependencies don't mention .ARCH)
  .infra is renamed to -infra
- we build textlive from source tarball
  - and package all binaries as subpkgs texlive-$subpkg-bin
  - all symlink-only .ARCH packages reside in texlive, which provides= them
- other binaries are repacked, as well as all non-binary packages

UPDATING:
- run update.sh to fetch from a CTAN mirror
- if needed:
        - adjust subpkgs for all binary packages we build yourself
        - run gen-subpkgs.sh > ~/vpkg-packages/srcpkgs/texlive/subpkgs
        - run gen-provides.sh > ~/vpkg-packages/srcpkgs/texlive/provides
        - run generated mklins.sh in ~/vpkg-packages/srcpkgs
        - build texlive package
- optional:
        - run findmissing.sh to see which pkgs will be built
- run buildmissing.sh to build them
